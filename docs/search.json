    "text": "1. Ridge Regression\nWhat it is: A method used to predict an outcome while avoiding overly complex models. Why it matters: It ensures the model does not overfit (memorize the data) but generalizes well to new data.\nExample: If you’re predicting student grades, Ridge Regression makes sure factors like “studytime” or “failures” do not dominate the model but work together for accurate predictions."

    "text": "2. Dummy Regressor\nWhat it is: A simple model that always predicts the average value of the outcome. Why it matters: It acts as a baseline to compare advanced models.\nExample: If the average math grade is 10.3, the Dummy Regressor will predict 10.3 for every student, no matter their study habits."

    "text": "3. StandardScaler\nWhat it is: A tool to scale numerical features so they have similar ranges. Why it matters: Prevents features with larger values (like age) from dominating the model.\nExample: In the student dataset, “age” ranges from 15 to 22, while “studytime” ranges from 1 to 4. StandardScaler adjusts both to a similar scale."

    "text": "4. Grid Search\nWhat it is: A method to test different settings for your model to find the best one. Why it matters: Helps improve the accuracy of predictions.\nExample: In Ridge Regression, “alpha” is a setting that balances simplicity and accuracy. Grid Search tries out different alpha values to find the one that works best."

    "text": "5. Cross-Validation\nWhat it is: A way to test a model on different parts of the data to ensure consistent results. Why it matters: It shows whether the model will perform well on new, unseen data.\nExample: Divide the student dataset into 5 parts. Use 4 parts for training and the last part for testing. Repeat this 5 times, testing a different part each time."

Mean Square Error (MSE)\nThese are ways to measure how well a model predicts outcomes: - MSE (Mean Squared Error): The average of squared differences between predictions and actual values. - RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error): Like MSE but easier to interpret since it’s in the same units as the outcome. - MAE (Mean Absolute Error): The average of the absolute differences between predictions and actual values.\nExample: If the model predicts a grade of 15 and the actual grade is 10: - MSE = ((15 - 10)^2 = 25) - RMSE = ( = 5) - MAE = (|15 - 10| = 5)"
